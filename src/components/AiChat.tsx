${testosteroneMatch ? `Your testosterone level is **${testValue} ${unit}**.` : "I couldn't precisely locate your testosterone values in the document."}

**Interpretation:**
Testosterone is a key hormone that affects muscle mass, bone density, fat distribution, red blood cell production, and sexual function. Optimal levels vary significantly based on age, sex, and time of day the test was taken.

**Normal reference ranges:**
- For men: Generally 300-1000 ng/dL (10.4-34.7 nmol/L)
- For women: Typically 15-70 ng/dL (0.52-2.4 nmol/L)

**What might affect your levels:**
- Age (levels naturally decline with age)
- Time of day (highest in morning)
- Medications
- Chronic health conditions
- Stress levels
- Sleep quality
- Diet and exercise habits

**Recommendations:**
- Discuss these results with your healthcare provider for proper interpretation
- Consider lifestyle factors that might influence hormone levels
- If levels are outside normal range, follow up with an endocrinologist or specialist
